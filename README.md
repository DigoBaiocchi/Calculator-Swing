# Calculator-Swing
Programmer Calculator developed using Java / Swing. 

Welcome to the my awesome calculator!!!
						
In this calculator, you are able to do calculations 
using base 2, 8, 10 and 16. The default selection is
Decimal, but if you toggle between the different 
bases the buttons, the register and the accumulator
will update accordingly.

The calculator performs regular arithmetic operations 
such as (+, -, *, / and mod) and also binary 
arithmetic operations (and, nand, etc.).

If you press any of the operators right after you 
completed an operation, it will use the current
accumulator as the register for the next operation.

Other buttons functionalities:
CLR => clears everything
ClrA => clears the accumulator
ClrR => clears the register
back => backspace one key click at a time in register.
